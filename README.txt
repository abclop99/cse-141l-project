1. Explain which programs/features work
	
	All three programs work.

2. Explain which programs/features don't work and what challenges you faced when implementing your design.

	What does not work:
	
	- Error message for invalid instruction for the assembler
	
	Challenges:
	
	- Figuring out how program 2 works
	- Realizing that I can use less registers by creating values using a few instructions
	- Selecting some bits using {thing1, thing2}[range] works in Questa, but not Quartus
	- Other unhelpful error messages

	- Debugging problems with the programs. A waveform isn't the most intuitive way to view a program.
	- Needing to know the instruction address of the beginning of a loop and the number of instructions in a branch

3. Include the link and passcode to your zoom video
